branch to do some work and then merge

            how do I create a branch?
            checkout tells us to go to a different place
            -b says create a new branch

            git checkout -b <name of your branch>

            to combine add and commit use

            keep prettier and code formatting off wen working with people, you can change syntax etc. "they will come for you!" JD says

            git commit -am 'message'


            to see all branches

            git branch
            hit Q when you are done viewing the branches

            to push the branch

            git push origin <branch name>

            to locally delete branch use

            git branch -d <name of branch>

            if you get a message that it wont delete use
            git branch -D <name of branch>

create a contact component --

NOTE\* Re. NETLIFY DEPLOY YOUR APP FIRST TO GET A SUCCESSFUL DEPLOYMENT, DONT DO A BUNCH OF WORK AND TRY TO DEPLOY ONLY TO BUG-HUNT FOR HOURS

EASIER TO ADD TO A WORKING CODEBASE THAN TO TROUBLESHOOT A FAILING DEPLOYMENT -- HELPS ELIMINATE POSSIBILITIES FOR ERRORS

1. create a local branch --> git checkout -b jg-contact

2. create a new component directory and contact component file

3. create component JS

4. check git status LOOK AT UPDATES

5. git add.

6. git commit -m <message>

7. import/add component to the JS

8. npm start, check to see if it works

9. go to github and see if our new branch is available then compare/pull request to merge -- update messageo or leave comment and create request

10. once merged, use git checkout <branch name> in our case main

11. delete local branch git branch -D jg-contact

12. pull all changes to main -- git pull origin main

13. check to deployed app to see if it deployed
