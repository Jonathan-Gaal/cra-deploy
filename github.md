            checkout tells us to go to a different place
            -b says create a new branch

            git checkout -b <name of your branch>

            to combine add and commit use

            keep prettier and code formatting off wen working with people, you can change syntax etc. "they will come for you!" JD says

            git commit -am 'message'
